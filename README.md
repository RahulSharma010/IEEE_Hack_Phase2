This repository contains the Smart Waste Management Optimization project, developed for the IEEE Hackathon. The project focuses on optimizing waste segregation processes through a software-driven solution. By leveraging advanced algorithms, it automates the identification and sorting of waste into predefined categories, such as recyclable, organic, and hazardous materials. The software enhances the accuracy and efficiency of waste management, aiming to improve overall sanitation and reduce environmental impact. Additionally, real-time alerts are generated to notify authorities for timely waste collection, preventing overflow and promoting cleaner urban spaces. The project emphasizes sustainability and efficient resource management, making it a valuable tool for modern waste disposal systems.
